name:Captain John Smith Chesapeake
weatherInfo:During the summer season visitors should dress in light, comfortable clothing, wear comfortable shoes and use sunscreen. We recommended you carry a bottle of water with you. High temperatures and high humidity create higher risk of heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Most of the Historic site is out-of-doors and although not a great distance from an air-conditioned building, staying properly hydrated will help prevent these illnesses. During the fall visitors should have a light jacket available.

description:Four hundred years ago Englishman John Smith and a small crew of adventurers set out in an open boat to explore the Chesapeake Bay. Between 1607 and 1609 Smith and his crew mapped nearly 3,000 miles of the Bay and rivers and documented American Indian communities. Smith’s map and journals are a remarkable record of the 17th-century Chesapeake. Come join the adventure on the Chesapeake Bay!

weatherInfo:Before you start your trip to the mountain, check the local weather forecast to be sure that you will have a dry time. Though we are located north of Atlanta, we're still have the same hot summers and mild winters as our neighbors. The mountain top generally ranges 8-10 degrees cooler than at the base. In fall and winter, be prepared with a light weight jacket on hand. After planning your activities, check back to see what the weather will have in store for your day.

description:For countless generations, American Indians have quarried the red pipestone found at this site. These grounds are sacred to many people because the pipestone quarried here is carved into pipes used for prayer. Many believe that the pipe's smoke carries one's prayer to the Great Spirit. The traditions of quarrying and pipemaking continue here today.

directionsUrl:http://www.nps.gov/sacn/planyourvisit/directions.htm
directionsInfo:The St. Croix National Scenic Riverway stretches for over 200 miles in northwest Wisconsin and east-central Minnesota. The Namekagon River flows entirely in Wisconsin while the St. Croix River serves as a border between the two states for much of its length. With many different access points there are numerous opportunities for day trips as well as multi-day paddling adventures. Visitor centers are located on the Namekagon River in Trego, Wisconsin, and on the St. Croix River in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.
weatherInfo:Access to the Riverway is year-round. Early spring temperatures can reach into the 40's resulting in high, fast, and cold water from melting snow and ice. Summers are warm and humid. Severe weather can be experienced anytime from mid-spring through late summer. Fall colors begin in late September with high temperatures averaging in the 60's. Winter can set in early with high temperatures in the teens, lows falling below zero, and occasional heavy snow. The rivers can begin to freeze over by early December.

description:The cinder cone volcano's rim is the dusky red of sunset, but the crater is only part of the story. Around 1085 the ground began to shake, and lava spewed high into the air. When the eruption finished, it had changed both the landscape and the people who lived here. Today, it teaches how nature and humankind affect each other—and how rebirth and renewal happen in the wake of disaster.

description:Crowning a desert hilltop is an ancient pueblo. A child scans the desert landscape for the arrival of traders. What riches will they bring? What stories will they tell? From the rooftop of the Tuzigoot pueblo it is easy to imagine such a moment. The pueblo shows us this ancient village built by the Sinagua people. They were farmers and artists with trade connections that spanned hundreds of miles.

Iced in by freezing temperatures and cut off from fresh water and game, 35 of 79 men died. As spring arrived and native people traded game for bread, the health of those remaining improved. Although the expedition moved on by summer, the beginning of French presence in North America had begun.

They have thrived for thousands of years in one of the harshest climates on Earth, hunting the bowhead, or "Agviq." In the 19th century, these lonely seas swarmed with commercial whalemen from New England, who also sought the bowhead for its valuable baleen and blubber.

directionsInfo:Kenai Fjords National Park is located just outside the town of Seward in south-central Alaska, 126 miles south of Anchorage. Even though the park is often inaccessible during the winter months, Seward is accessible year-round via the Seward Highway, a National Scenic Byway.

Follow the Seward Highway (AK-1) south from Anchorage. It will become AK-9 around mile 35 (87 miles from Anchorage) with AK-1 heading to Homer and Kenai. Continue on AK-9 to Seward.
directionsUrl:http://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/directions.htm
weatherInfo:The weather  Kenai Fjords is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The area generally enjoys a relatively temperate maritime climate, primarily due to the influence of the Japanese current that flows through the Gulf of Alaska.

Summer daytime temperatures range from the mid 40s to the low 70s (Fahrenheit). Overcast and cool rainy days are frequent. Winter temperatures can range from the low 30s to -20.
url:https://www.nps.gov/kefj/index.htm
description:The park is open year-round.  The primary months to visit are June, July, and August.  There are reduced services in the area during the months of May and September.

The road to the Exit Glacier area is not plowed during the winter months, and is closed to vehicle traffic once it is covered in snow and ice.

The park's coastal backcountry in also largely inaccessible late fall through the early spring due to rough seas.

The interior gets half to one fourth as much precipitation, but temperatures are hotter in summer and colder in winter.  Frost and snow can occur any time parkwide, but are most common from September to early June. Lakes here typically begins freezing in November and melting in April.

weatherInfo:Summer is typically cool and wet, with highs typically in the upper 50s to low 60s, and lows in the 40s. On occasion, summer highs reach the low 80s, though this is rare. Snow can fall any month of the year, so be prepared for chilly weather even in summer.

description:Denali is six million acres of wild land, bisected by one ribbon of road. Travelers along it see the relatively low-elevation taiga forest give way to high alpine tundra and snowy mountains, culminating in North America's tallest peak, 20,310' Denali. Wild animals large and small roam unfenced lands, living as they have for ages. Solitude, tranquility and wilderness await.

directionsInfo:Kenai Fjords National Park is located just outside the town of Seward in south-central Alaska, 126 miles south of Anchorage. Even though the park is often inaccessible during the winter months, Seward is accessible year-round via the Seward Highway, a National Scenic Byway.

Follow the Seward Highway (AK-1) south from Anchorage. It will become AK-9 around mile 35 (87 miles from Anchorage) with AK-1 heading to Homer and Kenai. Continue on AK-9 to Seward.
directionsUrl:http://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/directions.htm
weatherInfo:The weather  Kenai Fjords is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The area generally enjoys a relatively temperate maritime climate, primarily due to the influence of the Japanese current that flows through the Gulf of Alaska.

Summer daytime temperatures range from the mid 40s to the low 70s (Fahrenheit). Overcast and cool rainy days are frequent. Winter temperatures can range from the low 30s to -20.
description:The park is open year-round.  The primary months to visit are June, July, and August.  There are reduced services in the area during the months of May and September.

The road to the Exit Glacier area is not plowed during the winter months, and is closed to vehicle traffic once it is covered in snow and ice.

The park's coastal backcountry in also largely inaccessible late fall through the early spring due to rough seas.

Half a million caribou migrate through, their tracks crisscrossing sculpted dunes. The Kobuk River is an ancient and current path for people and wildlife.

title:Lake Clark Entrance and User Fees
description:You do not need to pay fees, make reservations, or obtain permits from the National Park Service for any recreational activities in the park including backpacking, camping, river running, bear viewing, or visiting Dick Proenneke's cabin.

directionsInfo:Lake Clark is located on the Alaska Peninsula southwest of Anchorage and north of Katmai National Park. It is not on the road system; therefore, in order to get here you must travel either via plane or by boat. A one to two-hour flight from Anchorage, Kenai, or Homer will provide access to most points within Lake Clark. Fixed-wing aircraft are allowed to land on all suitable lakes, rivers, beaches, gravel bars, and open ground in both the park and preserve unless the area is closed or otherwise restricted.

weatherInfo:Temperatures are relatively cool all year, thanks to the park and preserve's high elevation. Conditions are most often calm, but winds can arise, especially in spring and during storm fronts.  Daytime temperatures feel warmer here year round due to intense high-altitude sunlight, and a scorching mid-day summer sand surface. Plan to explore the dunes morning or evening during summer. Nights are cool in summer, and frigid in winter. Visit the Great Sand Dunes website for the most accurate weather forecasts.

However, renewed fighting in Chattanooga that November provided Union troops victory and control of the city. After the fighting, a Confederate soldier ominously wrote, "This...is the death-knell of the Confederacy."

description:The cinder cone volcano's rim is the dusky red of sunset, but the crater is only part of the story. Around 1085 the ground began to shake, and lava spewed high into the air. When the eruption finished, it had changed both the landscape and the people who lived here. Today, it teaches how nature and humankind affect each other—and how rebirth and renewal happen in the wake of disaster.

description:To Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Vicksburg was the "nailhead that holds the South's two halves together."  President Abraham Lincoln remarked "Vicksburg is the key" to victory, and could be the north's lifeline into the south.  

As the federals closed in on the Fortress City, they were met by a ring of forts with over 170 cannon. The resulting battle would determine the war's outcome.

Here, the Assiniboine and six other Northern Plains Indian Tribes exchanged buffalo robes and smaller furs for goods from around the world, including cloth, guns, blankets, and beads.

description:Come to the North Country. Trek the hills and valleys. Stand on the shores of lakes & streams from glaciers 10,000 years before. Clear-flowing water, red/gold of autumn, a fairyland of snow, open prairies, and distant horizons paint the land. Historic sites along the way tell how America settled and grew as a nation. From North Dakota to New York (and soon Vermont), adventure is never far away.

description:When Theodore Roosevelt came to Dakota Territory to hunt bison in 1883, he was a skinny, young, spectacled dude from New York. He could not have imagined how his adventure in this remote and unfamiliar place would forever alter the course of the nation. The rugged landscape and strenuous life that TR experienced here would help shape a conservation policy that we still benefit from today.
